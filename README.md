# Bookshop

A simple bookshop built using React and Sass. Started as a simple project to learn the basics of React and Sass, it grew rapidly as I learned new things. This is therefore more of a first experiment. There are many things that can be improved, such as making the various components manage their own state, as to not rely heavily on the main component, re-factoring the code to get rid of repetition, make a better use of Sass mixins and variables (the Sass mixins I've been using throughout the application were designed for an app with three simple components; for the current project more variables an mixins should have been used) and other minor issues. Please feel free to point them out with an issue, or suggest changes with a PR.
